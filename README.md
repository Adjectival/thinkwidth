### Description
Think with Resizing closely copies the flexible, responsive layout of [Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/) as a demonstration of my front-end design chops.




# User Stories
- I want to replicate the responsive top section of [Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/). Note: Navigation bar is optional.

 - I want relative units used where appropriate.

 - I want page layout to respond to at least three different screen sizes.

 - I want fluid images.

 - I do not need to use the same styling/code techniques as their actual website, nor the same fonts/assets.
- Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.


## Technologies Used
- Application: HTML5, CSS3
- Design: CSS3 leveraging Skeleton boilerplate
- Testing: Chrome
